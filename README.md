An easy-to-use bug-submission for for LibreOffice, in HTML and JS.

# Files #

submitbug.html - Older, pre-wizard-mockup version
wizardmockup.html - Newer design, which is much nicer to use.
index.php - The wizard mockup code was becoming unmanageable, so I plan to use [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com) templates to generate the slides. So far I haven't decided how that will work.

# Directories #

* css - CSS files
* images - Images
* include - PHP classes
* js - Javascript files
* misc - Various files hat aren't directly related to the submit form. (Needs cleaning)
* templates - Mustache templates for generating the page
