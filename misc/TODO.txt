TODO:
* Finish blurbs, and wikify them.
* Generate a text description of the bug from the selected options.
* Get the page to display the 'Continue' button when reach the end of the questions.
* If Linux crash, mention backtrace. If windows, request error text.

RESEARCH:
* Find-out things that are needed/wanted for bug reports, and get them included in the questions.
* Is it possible to directly post a bug without visiting the bugzilla page?
* Can the bugzilla form be filled-in via GET or POST?
* Is there a standard format for stuff that's included in bug reports?
