===Make the file as small as possible===
In order to be most helpful, please make documents as small as possible,
while still causing the bug. The simplest way of doing this is known as
''binary chopping''.

# First, save a backup copy of the document.
# Open the document up in its native application:
#* For .doc files, this will be Mcrosoft Word.
#* For ODF files (.odt, .ods, etc) this will be LibreOffice.
# Then, repeatedly:
## Delete the top half of the document.
## Save it as a new document.
## Open the document in LibreOffice.
## Is the problem still there?
##* If so, go back to the start of step 3.
##* Otherwise, go back to the previous copy (or backup) and try step 3
again with the second half of the document.
# Once you have reduced the document down to the part that causes problems,
(making sure to remove any confidential information), attach it to the
bug report.
